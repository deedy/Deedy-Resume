personalResume
=========================

## Introduction

I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia. My academics are STEM oriented (double major in Computer Science and Environmental Sciences) with a trajectory towards software development; I care deeply about public service in my personal life.

This repo is intended to hold my most recent personal resumé. All credits for original authorship go to Debarghya Das.

## Details

// CREDITS to Debarghya Das.

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student.
As of **v1.2**, there is an option to choose from two templates:

1. **MacFonts** - uses fonts native to OSX - *Helvetica*, *Helvetica Neue* (and it's Light and Ultralight versions) and the CJK fonts *Heiti SC*, and *Heiti TC*. The EULA of these fonts prevents distribution on Open Source.
2. **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

// CREDITS to Debarghya Das.

Common LaTeX resume-builders such as [**moderncv**](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/moderncv-cv-and-cover-letter)  and the [**friggeri-cv**](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv) look great if you're looking for a multi-page resume with numerous citations, but usually imperfect for making a thorough, single-page one. A lot of companies today search resumes based on [keywords](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-big-companies-have-a-tracking-system-that-scans-your-resume-for-keywords-2012-1) but at the same time require/prefer a one-page resume, especially for undergraduates. 

This template attempts to **look clean**, highlight **details**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating**.

## Dependencies

// CREDITS to Debarghya Das.

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.
2. Uses fonts that are usually only available to **Mac** users such as Helvetica Neue Light.
