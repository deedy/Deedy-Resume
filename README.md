Deedy-Resume
=========================

A **one page** , **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student, that preferably uses a **Mac** .

## Motivation

Common LaTeX resume-builders such as [**moderncv**](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/moderncv-cv-and-cover-letter)  and the [**friggeri-cv**](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv) look great if you're okay with a multipage resume with numerous citations, but usually isn't ideal for making a thorough single-page one. A lot of companies today search resumes based on [keywords](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-big-companies-have-a-tracking-system-that-scans-your-resume-for-keywords-2012-1) but at the same time require/prefer a one page resume, especially for undergraduates. 

This template attempts to **not look horrible**, allow **detail**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating**.
